# Job Finder App

### Hello, This app created with create-react-app.

- I used React as Javascript Library and Tailwind as CSS framework.
- I also used React-router and React-icons as 3rd party packages.
- I used localStorage for dark-light theme and holding username.

In this app, you can see all jobs and filter them by role, level and languages. You can apply for jobs and see the jobs that you applied for in your profile page. You can also cancel your applications.

You can check my challenge deploy from right side of the page, under the 'About' section.

Design was created as responsive.

This challange provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). You can check this challenge page from [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt/hub/job-listings-with-filtering-MckZC8DxsD).
In addition to challenge, i added dark/light theme, profile page with job applications, customize the header a little bit and extra little details.
